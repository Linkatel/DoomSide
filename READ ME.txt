Thanks at this person to have make this tutorial because it's a project i wanted to do but didn't know how.
The game is in pre-alpha and this part is probably gonna be a demo.
If you like the game, don't hesitate to let me know via github or via a website that I probably develop in the future (if i make a website, i will put the link on this document and probably on the github).
If you have any ideas, put them on the github comments.
This game is not copyright so please dont take my code without reference at me and @CoderSpaceChannel.
Thanks to play and Good Game !!!
